Throughout our journey, we **committed**, numerous times, and achieved a game we are now happy to present to you.

As the paramount flagship of Cookie domination, Cookie Monster was an obvious choice. 

We did hesitate with Darth Vader though (as the saying goes:  *come to the Dark Side, we have Cookies*).


## Rules
***

Rules aren't much complicated, besides, you will find some explanations given by our lord Cookie Monster.

His time is precious though, don't waste it! Start collecting them Cookies!
