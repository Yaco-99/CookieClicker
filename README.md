Intended as an exercise to train our coding skills, this Cookie Clicker was developed by a brave team of 4 teammates.

Throughout our journey, we **committed**, numerous times, and achieved a game we are now happy to present to you.

## Icon

As the paramount flagship of Cookie domination, Cookie Monster was an obvious choice. 

We did hesitate with Darth Vader though (as the saying goes:  *come to the Dark Side, we have Cookies*).


## Rules

Rules aren't much complicated, besides, you will find some explanations given by our lord Cookie Monster.

His time is precious though, don't waste it! Start collecting them Cookies!
